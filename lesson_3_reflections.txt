When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to use a remote repository when I am working on a project with others like my teammates and we collaborate and share data with each other to reach the final version we want and expect of our code. In fact, a remote repository has a merit over a local one in some way since we can access it anytime from any computer unlike the local repository that we must access it from just the computer it was created on or the computer it is stored in.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I like pulling changes manually because that way, when I'm working on code, it doesn't change without me expecting it. For example, if I know the new version of some code is broken, I might not want to pull that change until I have the bug fixed.
